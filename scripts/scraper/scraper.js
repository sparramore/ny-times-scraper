/*this is the control object for scraping. it's going to reference site specific
JS files and use their functions without knowing what needs to happen in each

TODO: for final project, figure out how we are going to reference the info
in order to be able to organize it. Perhaps the Site Objects are going to have
to provide that information in the form of tags. 

so for this small example we are going to have a tag for the concept they are
#DataStructure-LinkedLists.

TODO:for GeekForGeeks specifically see if we can distinguish between the 
Data structures provided in our page. if not they are going to have to go 
with just a generic data structures tag.
